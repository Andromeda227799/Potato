With the help of our application one can sell/lend useless or unused items or could even buy/borrow things from nearby people. This application will help in connecting people with similar needs and requirements.


People sometimes buy things such as vegetables which may expire and would remain unused. They feel that their money is lost because they can’t use something after it’s expiration. People also have a lot of useless things at their home which they feel like throwing out. Finally there are some people as well who want to borrow or use things from people nearby for ex: borrowing sugar for tea from neighbour
